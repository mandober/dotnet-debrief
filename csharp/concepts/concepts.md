- Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache (GAC)    
  How to create and use assemblies.
- Asynchronous Programming   
  write asynchronous solutions by using the async and await.
- Attributes   
  provide additional information about programming elements such as types, fields, methods, and properties by using attributes.
- Caller Information    
  obtain information about the caller of a method. This information includes the file path and the line number of the source code and the member name of the caller.
- Collections  
  Describes some of the types of collections provided by the .NET Framework.
- Covariance and Contravariance   
  how to enable implicit conversion of generic type parameters in interfaces and delegates.
- Expression Trees    
  use expression trees to enable dynamic modification of executable code.
- Iterators    
  step through collections and return elements one at a time
- Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)    
  powerful query capabilities in the language syntax of C#, and the model for querying relational databases, XML documents, datasets, and in-memory collections.
- Object-Oriented Programming    
  common oo concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Reflection    
  use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.
- Serialization    
  key concepts in binary, XML, and SOAP serialization.
