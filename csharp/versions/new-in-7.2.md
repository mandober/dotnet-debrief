# What's new in C# 7.2
08/16/2017

C# 7.2 is another point release that adds a number of useful features. One theme for this release is working more efficiently with value types by avoiding unnecessary copies or allocations.

The remaining features are small, nice-to-have features.

C# 7.2 uses the language version selection configuration element to select the compiler language version.

The new language features in this release are:

Techniques for writing safe efficient code
A combination of syntax improvements that enable working with value types using reference semantics.
Non-trailing named arguments
Named arguments can be followed by positional arguments.
Leading underscores in numeric literals
Numeric literals can now have leading underscores before any printed digits.
private protected access modifier
The private protected access modifier enables access for derived classes in the same assembly.
Conditional ref expressions
The result of a conditional expression (?:) can now be a reference.
Safe efficient code enhancements
Language features introduced in 7.2 let you work with value types while using reference semantics. They are designed to increase performance by minimizing copying value types without incurring the memory allocations associated with using reference types. The features include:

The in modifier on parameters, to specify that an argument is passed by reference but not modified by the called method. Adding the in modifier to an argument is a source compatible change.
The ref readonly modifier on method returns, to indicate that a method returns its value by reference but doesn't allow writes to that object. Adding the ref readonly modifier is a source compatible change, if the return is assigned to a value. Adding the readonly modifer to an existing ref return statement is an incompatible change. It requires callers to update the declaration of ref local variables to include the readonly modifier.
The readonly struct declaration, to indicate that a struct is immutable and should be passed as an in parameter to its member methods. Adding the readonly modifier to an existing struct declaration is a binary compatible change.
The ref struct declaration, to indicate that a struct type accesses managed memory directly and must always be stack allocated. Adding the ref modifier to an existing struct declaration is an incompatible change. A ref struct cannot be a member of a class or used in other locations where it may be allocated on the heap.
You can read more about all these changes in Write safe efficient code.

Non-trailing named arguments
Method calls may now use named arguments that precede positional arguments when those named arguments are in the correct positions. For more information see Named and optional arguments.

Leading underscores in numeric literals
The implementation of support for digit separators in C# 7.0 didn't allow the _ to be the first character of the literal value. Hex and binary numeric literals may now begin with an _.

For example:

C#

Copy
int binaryValue = 0b_0101_0101;
private protected access modifier
A new compound access modifier: private protected indicates that a member may be accessed by containing class or derived classes that are declared in the same assembly. While protected internal allows access by derived classes or classes that are in the same assembly, private protected limits access to derived types declared in the same assembly.

For more information see access modifiers in the language reference.

Conditional ref expressions
Finally, the conditional expression may produce a ref result instead of a value result. For example, you would write the following to retrieve a reference to the first element in one of two arrays:

C#

Copy
ref var r = ref (arr != null ? ref arr[0] : ref otherArr[0]);
The variable r is a reference to the first value in either arr or otherArr.
