## Operators

- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
- Increment: ++
- decrement: --
- Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, is
- String concatenation: +
- Logical/bitwise operations: &, |, ^, !, ~, &&, ||
- Conditional logical operators: &, |
- Conditional ternary operator: ?:
- Short-circuit conditional logical operators: &&, ||
- Indexing, []
- Casting: (), as
- Assignment, =
- Compond Assignment: +=, -=, =, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
- null coalescing operators: ??
- Bit shift: <<, >>
- Type information: sizeof, typeof
- Delegate concatenation and removal: +, -
- Overflow exception control: checked, unchecked
- address of (unsafe): &
- dereference (unsafe): *
- dereferencing member access (unsafe): ->


## null conditional

`x?.y` null conditional member access.
Returns null if the left-hand operand evaluates to null.

`x?[y]` null conditional index access.
Returns null if the left-hand operand evaluates to null.
