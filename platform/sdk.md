Microsoft Windows SDK, and its predecessors Platform SDK and .NET Framework SDK, are software development kits (SDK) containing docs, headers, libraries, samples and tools required to develop applications for Windows and .NET Framework.

Platform SDK specializes in developing applications for Windows 2000, XP and Windows Server 2003. .NET Framework SDK is dedicated to developing applications for .NET Framework 1.1 and .NET Framework 2.0. Windows SDK is the successor of the two and supports developing applications for Windows XP and later, as well as .NET Framework 3.0 and later.
