# .NET Terms


## Active Template Library
The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes developed by Microsoft, intended to simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. The COM support in Microsoft Visual C++ allows developers to create a variety of COM objects, OLE Automation servers, and ActiveX controls.

## Entity Framework - EF
EF is an open source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for ADO.NET. It was a part of .NET Framework, but since Entity framework version 6 it is separated from .NET framework.


## ASP.NET
is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.

## ASP.NET Core
is a free and open-source web framework, and higher performance than ASP.NET, developed by Microsoft and the community. It is a modular framework that runs on both the full .NET Framework, on Windows, and the cross-platform .NET Core.

## ASP.NET MVC
is a web application framework developed by Microsoft, which implements the Model–View–Controller pattern. It is open-source software, apart from the ASP.NET Web Forms component which is proprietary.

## ASP.NET Web Forms
is a web application framework and one of several programming models supported by the Microsoft ASP.NET technology. Web Forms applications can be written in any programming language which supports the Common Language Runtime, such as C# or Visual Basic. Main building blocks of Web Forms pages are server controls, which are reusable components responsible for rendering HTML markup and responding to events.

## SignalR
is a software library for Microsoft ASP.NET that allows server code to send asynchronous notifications to client-side web applications. The library includes server-side and client-side JavaScript components.

## ADO.NET
ADO.NET is Microsoft's data access technology, a part of framework's BCL, that enables communication between relational databases through a common set of components. It provides access to the data and services to programmers, allowing them to modify data stored in relational, but also non-relational, database systems.

## F#
is a strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. F# is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language, but it can also generate JavaScript and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.

## ML.NET
is a free software machine learning library for the C#, F# and VB.NET programming languages. It also supports Python models when used together with NimbusML. The preview release of ML.NET included transforms for feature engineering like n-gram creation, and learners to handle binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks.

## MSBuild
Microsoft Build Engine is a free and open-source build tool set for managed code as well as native C++ code and was part of .NET Framework. Visual Studio depends on MSBuild, but not the vice versa. Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management depends on MSBuild to perform team builds via the Team Foundation Server.

## NuGet
is a free and open-source package manager designed for the Microsoft development platform (formerly known as NuPack). Since its introduction in 2010, NuGet has evolved into a larger ecosystem of tools and services.

## PowerShell
is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. Initially a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core. The former is built on .NET Framework while the latter on .NET Core.
