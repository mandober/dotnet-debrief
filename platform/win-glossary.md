## Windows Communication Foundation
WCF is a runtime and a set of APIs in the .NET Framework for building connected, service-oriented applications.

## PowerShell
PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language.

## Windows PowerShell
Windows PowerShell is the original Windows-only shell. In August 2016 it was open-sourced, but this original version maintained its course, staying a Windows-only app with Windows specific APIs. At the moment `PowerShell 6.0` is the Core variant, while `PowerShell 5.1` refers to the old one.

## PowerShell Core
In August 2016, Windows PowerShell was open-sourced, giving birth to the cross-platform version called PowerShell Core, build on .NET Core. At the moment `PowerShell 6.0` is the Core variant, while `PowerShell 5.1`refers to the old one.

## WinJS
Windows Library for JavaScript (WinJS) is an open-source JS library developed by Microsoft.

## Chakra
is a JavaScript engine developed by Microsoft for its Microsoft Edge web browser. It is a fork of the JScript engine used in Internet Explorer. Like the Edge layout engine and unlike previous versions in Internet Explorer the declared intention is that it will reflect the "Living Web". On December 5, 2015, it was announced that core components of Chakra will be open-sourced as ChakraCore.

## Windows Runtime
Windows Runtime (WinRT) is a platform-agnostic application architecture.
WinRT supports development in C++/WinRT (standard C++), C++/CX (Component Extensions, a language based on C++), JavaScript/TypeScript, and the managed languages C# and Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET). 

WinRT applications natively support both the x86 and ARM processors, and may run inside a sandboxed environment to allow greater security and stability. WinRT components are designed with interoperability between multiple languages and APIs in mind, including native, managed and scripting languages. Windows Phone 8.1 uses a version of the Windows Runtime named the Windows Phone Runtime. It enables developing applications in C# and VB.NET, and Windows Runtime components in C++/CX.
