# .net installation


Install .net sdk

Create app: `dotnet new console -o qc`
  - `dotnet` command creates a new app of type *console*
  - `-o` param creates a dir named `qc` for new app, with required files.
  - the main file in the `qc` folder is `Program.cs`
  - by default, it already contains some boilerplate
Run app by issuing (in the app's root folder): `dotnet run`
