## Marshalling
Marshalling is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission.

Marshalling and serialization are loosely synonymous in the context of remote procedure call (RPC), but semantically different as a matter of intent. Namely, marshaling is about transmitting parameters, while serialization is about copying structured data to/from a primitive such as the byte stream. In this sense, serialization is a means to an end to perform marshalling, usually implementing pass-by-value semantics.
