## ACID
In database systems, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) refers to a standard set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably.
ACID is especially concerned with how a database recovers from any failure that might occur while processing a transaction.
An ACID-compliant DBMS ensures that the data in the database remains accurate and consistent despite any such failures.

## Database Schema
A schema is the organisation and structure of a database. A schema contains schema objects, which could be tables, columns, data types, views, stored procedures, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.
