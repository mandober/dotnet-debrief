SQL Server is an enterprise RDBMS developed by Microsoft, a more sophisticated and robust system than *Microsoft Access*, which is meant for home users.

SQL Server's main competitors are *Oracle Database*, *MySQL* (originally ABC, now Oracle), *MariaDB* (community fork of MySQL), *PostgreSQL* (PGDG), *DB2* (IBM).

SQL Server is a client-server based system, which means that it operates as a server, typically containing many databases, with multiple clients accessing the databases from across a network. These clients are often other applications (such as a website or CRM system).

Besides being available as a box product, SQL Server is also available as a cloud-based service called *Azure SQL Database*. SQL Server comes with *SQL Server Management Studio* (SSMS), a GUI app that can manage both SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.


SQL Server 2016 integrates:
* **Database Engine**: the core service for storing, processing and securing data.
* R Service: provide two server platforms for integrating the R language with business applications: SQL Server R Services (In-Database), for integration with SQL Server, and Microsoft R Server. R is used by statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.
* Data Quality Services (DQS): data-cleansing, knowledge base system.
* Integration Services: platform for data integration and data transformations.
* Master Data Services: create and manage trusted version of data as it changes over time.
* Analysis Services: Microsoft's data warehousing solution.
