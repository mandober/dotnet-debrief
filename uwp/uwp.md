Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is an open source API created by Microsoft that will potentially run on multiple types of devices.

UWP was first introduced in Windows 10, designed as an extension to the Windows Runtime platform (WinRT), which it came to succeed.

UWP aids in development of universal apps, which can run on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One and HoloLens, using the same code written in C++, C#, VB.NET and XAML. The API is implemented in C++ and it currently supports C++, VB.NET, C#, F# and JavaScript.
