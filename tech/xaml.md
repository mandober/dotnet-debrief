# XAML

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language

Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a declarative, XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used for initializing structured values and objects.

XAML is used extensively in .NET Framework, particularly with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) as a UI markup language, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) to define workflows; it is also used in Silverlight, Windows Runtime XAML framework and Windows Store apps.

XAML elements map directly to CLR object instances, and XAML attributes map to CLR properties and events on those objects.

Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed using a more traditional .NET language, such as C#. Being based on XML and being a declarative markup language is the key aspect of XAML; this reduces complexity by forgoing the need to further process the files, thereby simplyfing collaboration and sharing of XAML resources.

Optionally, a XAML file may be compiled into a Binary Application Markup Language (BAML) file, and added as a resource to a .NET Framework project; the framework will then extracts the BAML file from assembly resources at run-time, and create a corresponding WPF visual tree or workflow.
