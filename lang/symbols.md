# Symbols

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/

Symbols (tokens, special characters) are predefined, contextual characters that modify the program element (a literal string, an identifier, or an attribute name) to which they are prepended.

Special characters:
- verbatim identifier character, `@`
- interpolated string character, `$`


## String interpolation

The `$` special character identifies a string literal as an interpolated string. An interpolated string is a string literal that might contain interpolated expressions. When an interpolated string is resolved to a result string, items with interpolated expressions are replaced by the string representations of the expression results. (since C# 6)
